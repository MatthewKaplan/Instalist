# Overview
<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding:2px 480px 20px 20px;">
<p style="font-size: 20.8px">InstaList is a mobile application built using React Native, that gives users the ability to buy and sell items online. I built this with the idea of creating a platform like Craigslist with an optional delivery service such as InstaCart.</p> 
<p style="font-size: 20.8px">The overall idea is that users can signup for a free account and can immediately start buying or selling items to other local users only (25 Miles). The reasoning for the strict range is that I would love to give users the option to have items delivered to them same day by licensed drivers from InstaCart. I think this would be a great service for a platform such as Craigslist, because people are often to busy or uncomfortable with meeting with a strangers from the web.</p>
